**Git Commit Message Formatting Rules:**
- Run `git status` to enumerate changes immediately before commit (concatenate with &)
- **Message Length:** Keep commit messages around 250 characters
- **Content Requirements:**
  - Enumerate ALL functional changes made
  - Use bullets (separate lines) for different changes
  - Provide meaningful descriptions beyond just class names
  - Avoid duplicate or redundant bullet points
  - Focus on functional impact, not implementation details
  - Use clear, descriptive commit titles

**Example Format:**
```
Add user authentication and role management
• Implement JWT token validation middleware
• Add role-based access control for admin routes
• Create user registration with email verification
• Update database schema for user permissions
```
