# Homelab Documentation

A comprehensive documentation of my homelab setup, including architecture, components, configurations, and reasoning behind design decisions.

## 🏠 Overview

This repository documents my personal homelab infrastructure, providing insights into the architecture, component choices, configurations, and the reasoning behind various technical decisions. The goal is to create a reference for future maintenance, upgrades, and for sharing knowledge with the community.
