## Documentation Goals
- **Architecture First**: Document the reasoning behind design decisions
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include all aspects from hardware to applications
- **Operational Focus**: Provide practical guidance for maintenance and troubleshooting
- **Security Emphasis**: Document security implementations and best practices
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Make documentation useful for others building similar setups

## Content Guidelines
- Include both "what" and "why" for all configurations
- Provide step-by-step procedures for complex tasks
- Document lessons learned and things to avoid
- Include diagrams and visual representations where helpful
- Maintain up-to-date configuration examples
- Document troubleshooting steps for common issues

## Documentation Standards
- Use clear, descriptive headings and consistent formatting
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting for configurations
- Add comments explaining non-obvious implementation decisions
- Provide links between related documentation sections
- Include version information and last updated dates
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for better readability

## When Working on This Repository
- **Adding New Services**: Create documentation in `docs/services/[service-name]/` with README.md, configuration.md, deployment.md, and troubleshooting.md
- **Architecture Changes**: Update both the main README.md and relevant docs/architecture/ files
- **Configuration Updates**: Always document the reasoning behind changes
- **Troubleshooting**: Add new issues and solutions to appropriate troubleshooting sections
- **Security Changes**: Document any security modifications in docs/security/

## File Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens for directories: `my-service-name/`
- Use descriptive names: `service-configuration.md` not `config.md`
- Include service/component names in filenames for clarity
- Use .md extension for all documentation files

## Common Tasks
- **New Service Documentation**: Create service directory with standard template files
- **Architecture Updates**: Update diagrams and explanations when infrastructure changes
- **Configuration Management**: Keep configuration examples current and tested
- **Troubleshooting Updates**: Add new solutions as issues are encountered and resolved
- **Security Reviews**: Regular updates to security documentation and procedures

## Context for AI Assistance
This is a technical documentation project for a homelab environment. When providing assistance:
- Focus on clarity and completeness in documentation
- Suggest best practices for homelab management
- Recommend security considerations for home environments
- Provide practical, tested solutions
- Consider both beginner and advanced perspectives
- Emphasize maintainability and documentation sustainability
